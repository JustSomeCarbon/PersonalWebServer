                I was born in Torrance, CA at the end of the twentieth century. By the time I was six, my
                family had decided to move from our house in Hawthorne to a small town called Taos in northern
                New Mexico. This was a big change for me since I had grown accustom to living close to family,
                but out in Taos I had no family nearby. It was just me and my parents. In Taos, I grew up; from
                elementary school, to middle school, to high school. But by the time I was well into middle school
                I had begun to take an interest in video game development. I played video games non-stop growing up,
                so as I learned more about them, the more I gained an interest in wanting to make my own. This is when
                my interest in computer science first appeared.

                Having absolutely no idea where to start, and not knowing that computer science even existed, I looked in
                the only place that has all the answers: the internet. After poking around a bit I found something promising,
                Scratch. For me, this was perfect. By then I had learned about programming, but being a kid in middle school
                it felt way too intimidating to just jump right into, so Scratch seemed perfect. And it was. My interest in
                programming only grew from there. By the time I entered High school I was tackling the next best thing I could
                find, Python. From there it seemed easy to walk into another language and begin learning. On my own I learned to
                read and build programs with Python, and then moved onto JavaScript before making my way to Java. On the way I
                took a few detours to learn some of the basics of HTML and CSS.

                Being the only person in what seemed like the high school interested in computer science was a bit lonely. With no
                peer to truly talk to about my progress nor a mentor to guide me, and at times it felt very limiting. In spite of that,
                I was able to convince the teacher responsible for the computer lounge at the school to create a computer science class
                that I could take so that I could devote a few hours a day at school learning to code.

                Moving from Taos after I graduated high school down to New Mexico Tech in Socorro a few hours away gave me the opourtunity
                to finally focus almost completely on the career path I had chosen. Tech was a small school, but its computer science program
                really opened me up to the broad world of computers. At Tech I learned a number of subjects including algorithm development and 
                analysis techniques, logic and logical applications, computer architecture, and oprating system and language development. I fell
                in love with the C programming language.
