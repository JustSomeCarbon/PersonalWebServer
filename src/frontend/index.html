                Hello! My name is Noe Garcia. I am a young and passionate software engineer
                looking to make a difference however I am able to. I am a recent graduate,
                and am currently looking to start my carrer in technology wherever I feel I
                can truly apply myself and make an impact.

                I am profficient in a number of languages including C, JavaScript, Python, Java,
                Golang, and Rust. I have an interest in always learning new langauges and skills,
                so I have experimented with a few different languages and taught myself how to work with them.
                Python, C, and JavaScript are my most profficient languages as I have commonly worked with
                them durring my time in university. During my time in university I also learned to work
                with Java, but have worked with it much less than I have the three aforementioned languages.
                Apart from those, I have taught myself how to work with Golang, and Rust from the available
                documentation and resources for the languages available online. I have much less practive with
                these languages but I enjoy them just as much!

                I am highly interested in backend software development. Building the logic and necessary server
                componenets for a web or native application are both challenging and engaging. With every new
                project comes new oppourtunities for growth. For that reason, I have always wanted to be a
                software engineer.
