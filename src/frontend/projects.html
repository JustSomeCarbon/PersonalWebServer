                <h3>Solace: The Funtional Programming Language</h3>
                <p>
                    Solace is a simple functional programming language I am developing in C. Solace takes
                    some inspiration from many different programming languages including C, Rust, Python,
                    and Elixir. This programming language is meant to be simple: easy to learn, easy and fun
                    to write with. Unlike other general purpose languages such as JavaScript and Python that
                    allow you to utilize the functional paradigm within the broader language, Solace is built
                    to be completely functional from the ground up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Progress is currently a bit slow as I am looking for work and sharpening a different set
                    of skills. However, I fully intend to complete Solace and expand on it in the future. Development
                    updates will be posted to my blog for the language:
